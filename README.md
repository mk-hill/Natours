# Natours

Natours is the website of a fictional travel agency which arranges tours in various natural settings. It was built to explore what could be achieved using CSS alone. As such, some functionality may be unavailable due to the project scope being limited to CSS. See the page live [here](https://mk-hill.github.io/Natours/) on GitHub Pages.


### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass (SCSS)

### Acknowledgement
This project was built as part of the [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) course by Jonas Schmedtmann. I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in expanding their CSS knowledge.
